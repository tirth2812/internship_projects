# DRIVING LICENSE CONTROLLED SMART VEHICLE SYSTEM
 I am currently in the process of designing and implementing a robust system for vehicles aimed at preventing unauthorized access, particularly by underage or unauthorized individuals. This innovative solution will incorporate advanced security measures to ensure that only authorized users have access to the vehicle. The system will utilize cutting-edge technology to enhance security protocols, providing a reliable safeguard against unauthorized usage. The ultimate goal is to create a secure and reliable environment for vehicle access, prioritizing safety and compliance with regulations.
