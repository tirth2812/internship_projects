Certainly! Here are some basic commands for the MySQL command line client:

- To connect to a MySQL server from the command line:
  mysql -u username -p
  
  (You will be prompted to enter the password after this command.)

To execute script:
  mysql -u root -p sales < Path/to/script/script.sql

To create a new database:
  CREATE DATABASE database_name;  

To remove/delete all databases:
  drop database database_name;

To select a database to work with:
  USE database_name;
  
To show all databases:
  SHOW DATABASES;
  
To display all tables within the current database:
  SHOW TABLES;
  
To see the structure of a table (the columns it contains):
  DESCRIBE table_name;  

To add data to a table:
  INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
  
To retrieve data from a table:
  SELECT * FROM table_name;
  
To update data in a table:
  UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;  

To delete data from a table:
  DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
  
To exit the MySQL command line client:
  EXIT;
  


These commands are the essentials to get started with managing databases and tables in MySQL. Remember to replace `username`, `database_name`, `table_name`, `column1`, `column2`, `value1`, `value2`, and `condition` with your actual database details. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute these commands.
